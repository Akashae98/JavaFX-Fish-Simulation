This project is an animated aquarium simulation built with JavaFX. 
Requeriments:
As its created in maven, we need to use the pom.xml to execute the libraries of JavaFX (this is required for JDK 9 and above).
Inside the pom.xml we have a pluggin that manages and executes the libraries. 
We also need the nbaction.xml that triggers the pluggin when running the aplication.
